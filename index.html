            <h2>About The Author</h2>
            <p>Anonymous Ryder is a Christian author writing fiction and Biblical commentary at the intersection of faith, moral responsibility, and human endurance.</p>
            <p>He brings to his work a background as an attorney in international human rights law and prior service as a U.S. Army soldier overseas. These experiences inform his focus on faith, authority, sacrifice, justice, and the internal cost of survival under pressure.</p>

            <p>He is currently in the final editing stages for his debut fiction novel, <em>Fire Within</em>.</p>
            <p>About the novel:</p>
            <p><em>The world ended in fire. What came after was colder.</em></p>
            <p><em>More than twenty years after the asteroid Apophis struck Earth. America is broken, split into city-states, ruled by corruption, haunted by famine, and scarred by the ash-covered winters that never ended.</em></p>
            <p><em>In this fractured world, Captain Joshua Walker serves as a soldier in a fading community on Long Island, clinging to order while his own life quietly unravels. When betrayal tears his life apart, Josh is cast into a brutal underworld of slavery, cults and survival.</em></p>
            <p><em>Carrying secrets even his closest friends don't know, he begins a long, perilous journey home to the people he loves and the man he wants desperately to become. But the world after Apophis doesn't reward mercy. And Josh's harder fight won't be with the men chasing him. It will be with his own soul.</em></p>
            <p><em>A story of justice and forgiveness, faith and fire, Fire Within is a haunting vision of America's future and one man's choice to open his hand when the world tells him to close it.</em></p>
