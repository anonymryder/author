            <h2>About The Author</h2>
            <p>Anonymous Ryder is a Christian author writing fiction and Biblical commentary at the intersection of faith, moral responsibility, and human endurance.</p>
            <p>He brings to his work a background as an attorney in international human rights law and prior service as a U.S. Army soldier overseas. These experiences inform his focus on faith, authority, sacrifice, justice, and the internal cost of survival under pressure.</p>
            <p>He is currently completing his debut fiction novel, Fire Within, a near-future story set in post-asteroid collapse America. The novel follows Captain Josh Walker as he navigates a fractured nation, testing the limits of duty, leadership, and belief amid societal ruin.</p>
            <p>In parallel, he is writing a non-fiction Biblical commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, aimed at careful readers seeking historical grounding, theological clarity, and faithful application.</p>
            <p>Both works are anticipated for completion by the end of 2026.</p>
